Project: Todo List

We will create our todo list task, and projects(categories), with a factory function
By default, the user only requires the name of the task, if there is no name, you cannot create that task

Our tasks would need:

None-expanded:
title, dueDate, priority? checklist(radio input) removeBtn(X)

Exanded:
title
description
dueDate
priority?
removeBtn
Project Location (dropdown menu of all the projects we have)

Checklist

We should have a side section for showing the projects,
We will edit/add/remove projects
and we can create new tasks, but only with name input, it will make everything else empty, and the user can edit everything else.
Create a Today, and This week category so we can view them all

Above the projects names should be the tasks that are in the project.

[tasks]
[project1]


Create an object, by default, that should be stored in an array that will be rendered into the page. That could be anything, just so the user has a project of some sort on first load up. 
  --That can be a general Project, that the user cannot remove.

Seperate application logic from the DOM-related stuff, so keep them in a different module.
